Luckily, we've developed what we call \"Loadouts\" to help simplify this process.\n\nToday we will talk about the \"Pro Loadout\". This is the recommended configuration for your xbox that allows your users to add and message friends and play online in a way that allows your to monitor and manage activity through CoPlay XM.\n\nPlease note that this configuration is only recommended to be used in combination with CoPlay XM as it allows your users more freedom in playing with friends and family members but also allows your to clean up and wipe the user activity via CoPlay XM when they are finished.\n\n\nThe CoPlay Pro Loadout\n\nThis loadout is designed to let patients play games with each other online while not allowing text or voice communication with anyone outside the hospital. Patients can message and voice chat with each other while Coplay XM clears any message history nightly so all PHI can be cleared from the device.
